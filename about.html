    		About me
    	</h1>

    	<p>I was born in May 17, 1999 at Janakpur, Nepal and currently I'm living at Kathmandu. I  completed my Secondary Level School from Everest Academy, Sarlahi and got admitted to Kathmandu Model College for high school.  </p>

    	<p>My main motive to become a web developer is to make people up-to-date about anything that they are interested in. And, regarding career, I'm currently interested to work for companies like MOBIKASA, MentorMate, Matellio, etc. as they are market leader in web designing. </p>
